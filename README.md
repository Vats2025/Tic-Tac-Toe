# Tic-Tac-Toe

Overview
This is a simple yet engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. It allows two players to take turns marking Xs and Os on a 3Ã—3 grid until a player wins or the game ends in a tie.

Features
- Two-player mode (X and O)
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter
- Automatic turn switching
- Win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Tie detection
- Restart button to start a new game
- Responsive window centering

Installation
To run this game, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Tkinter comes pre-installed with standard Python distributions.

How to Play
- The game starts with Player X.
- Click on any empty tile to place your mark.
- The game 'announces the winner' when three marks align in a row, column, or diagonal.
- If all tiles are filled and no player has won, the game **results in a tie**.
- Click the Restart button to reset the game.
